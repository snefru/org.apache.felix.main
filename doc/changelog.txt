  properties when using the standard launcher. (FELIX-250)

* [2007-04-13] The javax.net and javax.net.ssl packages were missing
  from the system packages properties.
* [2007-04-13] Fixed a bug where the launcher was not correctly calculating
  the installation directory correctly.

  in main JAR.
